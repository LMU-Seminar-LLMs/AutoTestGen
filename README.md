## Description

AutoTestGen analyzes code segments and uses Large Language Models (OpenAI ChatCompletion model endpoints) to autonomously generate unit tests.
It was developed as part of the **Practical Applications for Large Language Models** seminar at LMU Munich under the guidance and supervision of Martin Binder.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: Ensure that you have Docker installed. You can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Docker Image containing Python 3.9+**: This application requires any docker image containing Python version 3.9 or higher. It is required to provide an isolated environment to avoid executing potentially malicious code generated by the LLM on your local machine.
If you don't have your custom image already do the following:

- Use provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to build a custom image, which additionally installs *coverage* package used in the application for measuring python code coverage. You are free to add other packages which the project you want to test requires. To build the image, run the following command: 
    ```sh
    docker build -t autotestgen:latest .
    ```

## Installation
To get started with this application, follow these simple installation steps:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:LMU-Seminar-LLMs/AutoTestGen.git

# Change into the project directory
cd AutoTestGen

# Install the AutoTestGen app
pip install .

# Run the application via the command line
autotestgen
```

## Usage

After starting the application **Introductory Frame** will be displayed.

![Introductory Frame](./assets/IntroFrame.png)
1. Select the language in which your code to be tested is written in.
2. Enter the docker image *name:tag* to use.
3. Select your project directory using *Open Repository* button.

After selecting the project directory, **Main Frame** will be displayed.

1. Authenticate via the menu bar. [See Authentication](#authentication)
2. Choose the file for testing by double-clicking on it in the file tree. [See File Tree](#file-tree)
3. Select function/method to test in the Object Tree. [See Object Tree](#object-tree)
4. Configure the test generation process. [See Test Configuration](#test-configuration)
5. Push the *Generate Tests* button to start the test generation process. [See Test Generation](#test-generation)

Both the prompts and the generated tests will be displayed in the *Chat Window* The user can continue communicating with the API through the *Chat Entry*.
All succesfully generated tests will be saved in the database and can be viewed in the *Tests Tree*. [See Tests Tree](#tests-tree)
